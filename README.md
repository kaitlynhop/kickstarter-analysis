# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of the Project

This project analyzes key datasets of kickstarter campaigns to assess for trends. Key data points include: goal amount, pledged amount, creation date, termination date, category, subcategory, and outcomes. The data was organized within Excel through the use of functions, data sorting, conditional formatting, and creation of pivot tables and charts. The outcomes were categorized as, "Successful", if the pledged amount was greater than or equal to the goal amount, "Failed", if the pledged amounts was less than the goal amount, or "Canceled", if the campaign was cancled without meeting the desired goal. In this project, the outcomes were assessed against the month of launch within theater campaigns and ranges of goal amounts for all campaign categories. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze data trends of kickstarter campaigns to organize and visualize factors that may predict outcomes of campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis Based on Launch Date
Kickstarter data was organized into a pivot table to display the trends between the launch month and outcomes. The data was filtered by theater category and portrayed as a line chart to show the trends of outcomes and monthly launch within theater campaigns. Below is the line chart showing outcomes of theater campaigns by month of launch. The line chart portrays a spike for successful outcomes for compaigns launched in the month of May and June. The campaigns with failed outcomes appears depicts a less sever flux throughout the months. The canceled campaigns remain relatively consistent between launch months.

### Analysis Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
