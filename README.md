# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Data analysis using Excel on crowdfunding data to determine the trends across operated campaigns.
## Results and Findings
The data was analyzed to show trends among kickstarter campaigns to be used to predict success rate in future campaigns.
The outcomes were observed against all parent categories, subcategories, and campaign launch date.
1. There were more successful theater and play campaigns than failed campaigns.

3. The average goal for successful US campaigns for plays was about half the average goal for failed US campaigns for plays.
4. For Great Britain musical campaigns, the average pledge amount is less than half the average goal amount. 
## Conclusion and Suggestions
Concerning the proposed campaign, it appears there is a trend between the campaign goal and its outcome. Successful US kickstarters for plays had average goals of $5,049 with the median of $3,000. However, failed US kickstarters for plays had an average of $10,554 with a median of $5,000. The corresponding pledge values for the successful compaigns had an average of $5,602, which is almost 10 times more than the average pledge values for failed plays, of $559, despite the higher goal.
Using this dataset, I would advise Louise to launch her campaign for her play in May, with a goal of $5,000. Depending on the actual amount raised, she should launch a second campaign to raised the additional amount.
